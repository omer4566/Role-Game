# Role-Game

A party game I created alone in 2020-2021

The game is basically werewolf but you can create custom roles and add them to the game, choose their mechanics, and customize your game.

special features:
- create profiles for each player that played the game in the same phone, and even save the profiles for future games in the profile list. (not cloud)
- create custom roles for the game with special abilities and mechanics.
for example
the user can make the werewolf have 2 kills instead of one. or maybe change the amount of werewolfs that can be in that game. and much much more.
